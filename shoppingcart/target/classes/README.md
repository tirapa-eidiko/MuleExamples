# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>

As a Customer I want API to cover Shopping Cart functionality. 
The API provides endpoints for saving to the shopping cart, updating, deleting and obtaining shopping cart. The details about content of shopping cart is fetch from Product System API. 

### POST/shoppingCarts/
This endpoint will trigger flow createShoppingCart which creates shopping cart with proper shopping cart Id to Object Store for customer 

### GET/shoppingCarts/{shoppingCartId}
This endpoint will trigger flow getShoppingCart which obtains shopping cart from Object Store by shoppingCartId 

### PUT/shoppingCarts/{shoppingCartId}
This endpoint will trigger flow getShoppingCart which updates shopping cart from Object Store by shoppingCartId 

### DELETE/shoppingCarts/{shoppingCartId}
This endpoint will trigger flow deleteShoppingCart which removes shopping cart by shoppingCartId.

### GET/customers/{customerId}/shoppingCarts/
This endpoint will trigger flow getShoppingCartsForCustomer which obtains shopping carts of customer by customerId. If customer does not exist, response is empty field of shopping carts.  
 
## Here in POST/shoppingCarts/ we use http connector to use retail-product-availability.raml for shipping,taxes and location details.basically this raml flow  can run in another server then we made request through http requester, it trigger that flow to get results.here i place both in single application with in process.raml itself.

### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)

### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 
 go to file menu click on import -> open anypoint studio  then
+ Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
+ Anypoint Studio Project from External Location
+ Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml
+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).

### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule-<env>.properties`, in src/main/app
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [mule-app.properties](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`

### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties](../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=dev`. 

## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to `"Manage Application"` > `"Properties"` to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured**.
Follow other steps defined [here](#runonpremise) and once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)

## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables.
Detailed list with examples:
